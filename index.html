      <h2>The Future of Education</h2>
      <p>
        According to <strong>Bernard</strong>, by the year <strong>2035</strong>, the role of teachers will change significantly. They will no longer be just content transmitters but will become <strong>guides</strong> and <strong>mediators</strong> of the learning process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education will no longer focus solely on acquiring specific knowledge. The focus will shift to <strong>continuous skills development</strong>, which should be adapted and improved throughout one's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the support of technology, learning will become increasingly <strong>personalized</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, and <strong>student-centered</strong>, preparing individuals for a constantly changing world.
